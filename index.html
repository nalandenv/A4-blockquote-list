        The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common
        ancestor about 10–15 million years ago. The genus Felis diverged from
        other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago. Results of phylogenetic
        research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric
        or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through
        artificial selection. The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor
        are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.The
        leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China
        around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace
        in the domestic cat populations of today.
